Fluid_HTML_Email_Template
=========================

A fluid HTML email template that works across all email clients, desktop and / or mobile.


This is a responsive HTML email template that will work across email clients, both desktop and mobile. If media queries are supported, the template will take advantage of that, otherwise, the columns will stack in the best way possible, depending on the screen resolution and client usedâ€¦

This particular template utilizes a 2 column layout, which is the most common template after a 1 column HTML email template. You can certainly make this into a 3 column layout, by adding a certain amount of nested tables. You can easily look at the code and use / copy the same format to add another column. The fluidity and the media queries (if supported), will take care of the rest...
